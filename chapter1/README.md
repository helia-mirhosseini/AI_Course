## ðŸ§  Algorithms Covered

The collection includes (but is not limited to):

| Category | Algorithms |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Supervised Learning** | Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, SVM |
| **Unsupervised Learning** | K-Means, DBSCAN, PCA, LDA |
| **Neural Networks** | Perceptron, Adaline, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) |
| **Optimization & Evaluation** | Gradient Descent, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, Cross-Validation |

Each notebook typically contains:
1. **Theoretical overview** (in Persian)
2. **Mathematical formulation**
3. **Python implementation** using `NumPy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`
4. **Visualization** and **result interpretation**
